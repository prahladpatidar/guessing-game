Guess the Number Game ðŸŽ²
This is a simple "Guess the Number" game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How to Play:

Refresh the page to start a new game.

Enter the maximum number for the guessing range.

Guess a number within that range.

The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.

Keep guessing until you find the correct number!

You can also type "quit" at any time to end the game.

I used the prompt() and console.log() functions to create the interactive gameplay loop, and some fun fonts from Google Fonts to give it a unique style.

Hope you have fun playing!
